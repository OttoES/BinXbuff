# BinXbuff
While still in its initial phase,the aim of this project is to take a definition file that specifies a message on 
a byte level and translate this into code. 
This tool can generate C, java and python to serialize and deserialize a byte stream of data. The byte stream is 
normally either data that must be stored on a file or sserial data, e.g. via RS232 or an RF link.  

The purpose is similar to other tools such as protobuff or flatbuff with the following differences:
- protobuff, etc focus on serialization and deserialization of objects, binXbuff focuses on the byte level definition
- this tool focus on embedded processors with limited memory
- messages are defined on byte level which means that that code can be generated for existing binary protocols 
- the C code generated by this tool will not use the heap (no alloc and free calls)
- the Java and python code is to complement the embedded C code for communicating with the embedded devices 

In addition to the features above, a program that can translate between json and he embedded binary protocol is also in he pipeline.
