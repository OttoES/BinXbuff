## Structures
___
### MsgHeader
   This is the common header for all messages.
Fields in this structure

|Field|Type|Array|Comment|
|------|-----|-----|------------------------------|
|magic|uint32|-| This is a magic number that indicates the start of the message.   This is the same as 0x900DBEEF in bigendian format|
|destAddr|uint8|-|        The destination address is where the message should be send to.        Devices are allocated a fixed address.The address for the master streamer         is always 0. Seat units are each configured with ther own addresses.        Messages can beeither directed to a single device or broadcasted         depending on the command. If it is a broadcast command the destinationwill still be for a spesific address and that address should send CMD_BROADCAST_ACK        acknowladges or a CMD_ACK_HEADER on sucess or a CMD_NACK on an error.         When broadcasted the broadcast address      |
|sourceAddr|uint8|-|  The source address.|
|cmd|enum8 [cmd_t](#enum-cmd_t)|-|  This is the message identifier. |
|Total| length|7|4+1+1+1|
### ReadMsg
   The read command reads information from the seat units, normally statistics    and state changes. The seat unit should respond with a CMD_READ_ACK or    CMD_NAC on failure.
