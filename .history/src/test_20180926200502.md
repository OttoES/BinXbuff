## Enumerations
___
### Enum cmd_t
 A list of all the commands. Note that all commands are send to a spesific
   address except the broadcast command. Most commands have an acknowladge
   but note:
   * each command have a paired acknowldge (ACK) command id
   * there is only one not acknowladge (NAC) command shared by all commands
   * the debug command is not acknowladged
   * a broadcast command is only acknowladced by one address


|Tag|Value|Comment|
|------|-----|------------------------------|
|CMD_BROADCAST|0x0A|  Broadcast |
|CMD_BROADCAST_ACK|0x03|  An acknowladge if the broadcast command was sucessfull |
|CMD_READ|0x15||
|CMD_READ_ACK|0x16||
|CMD_WRITE|0x29||
|CMD_WRITE_ACK|0x30|  Acknowladge send on a write|
|CMD_WR_SLAVE|0x3D|  Not used: Reserved to be used to write to a single seat unit.|
|CMD_DEBUG|0x1A|  DevOnly: Debug command only and should be ignored otherwise.|
|CMD_NACK|0x04|  A negative ackowladge used if any command failed  |
|CMD_ACK_HEADER|0x05|  An acknowladge used if the header was recieved withhout error.  |

## Structures
___
### MsgHeader

 This is the common header for all messages.

Fields in this structure


|Field|Type|Array|Comment|
|------|-----|-----|------------------------------|
|magic|uint32|-| This is a magic number that indicates the start of the message.   (This is 0x900DBEEF in bigendian format)|
|destAddr|uint8|-|        The destination address is where the message should be send to.        Devices are allocated a fixed address. The address for the master streamer         is always 0. Seat units are each configured with ther own addresses.        Messages can be either directed to a single device or broadcasted         depending on the command. If it is a broadcast command the destination        will still be for a spesific address and that address should send CMD_BROADCAST_ACK        acknowladges or a CMD_ACK_HEADER on sucess or a CMD_NACK on an error.         When broadcasted the broadcast address      |
|sourceAddr|uint8|-|  The source address.|
|cmd|enum8 [cmd_t](#enum-cmd_t)|-|  This is the message identifier. |
|subCmd|uint8|-|   |
|len|uint16|-|  he lenghth of he data |
|seqNr|uint16|-|  A sequence number send with the request|
|crc16|CRC16|-|  crc use for integrity checking|
|Total| length|14|4+1+1+1+1+2+2+2|
### ReadMsg

  The read command reads information from the seat units, normally statistics
  and state changes. The seat unit should respond with a CMD_READ_ACK or
  CMD_NAC on failure.
